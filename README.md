# Down to Friend
DTF - Down to Friend aims to take the inherently insular idea of modern social networks and turn it on its head. Rather than developing a culture of exclusivity, we seek to create the kind of enviroment that social networks always should've been working toward in the first place - a way for strangers to become not strangers anymore, through intentionally seeking out shared experiences in the real world.
